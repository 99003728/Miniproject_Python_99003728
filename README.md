## working environment

Code works perfectly in Pycharm. In case of VS-code please make sure it has 
all the extensions installed.


## Description 

This code is used to search the words asked by the
user and based on the number of keywords entered, a separate 'keyword.txt' file
is created where the keyword and its adjacent words are written in new line for
each word in respective files. In case of entered keyword not available in the
file it displays appropriate error message for that.
